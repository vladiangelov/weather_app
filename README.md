# My Weather App

### Description

This is a weather forecast application, built entirely in React, using React Hooks and styled components, hence all components are entirely functional. It also utilised PropTypes for props checking. It has been bootstrapped using the creat-react-app package and is built on top of this.

Data is fetched in real time from the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api/) - two separate endpoints are used - first one to determine the geolocation of the city/town name that is entered (i.e. London) and second one is using this geolocation (in lattitude and longitude) to fetch the weather data.
